# 01 - Handling data

In this tutorial session we explore the fundamental features of [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), we practice the basics of Data Wrangling and we will see how to retrive data from the Web.
When you are (or if you already are) familiar with Pandas, you can move to the execise notebook.


We recommend the following order:
